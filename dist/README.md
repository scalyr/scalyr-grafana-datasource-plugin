# Scalyr data source for Grafana

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/scalyr/scalyr-grafana-datasource-plugin/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/scalyr/scalyr-grafana-datasource-plugin/tree/master)

The Scalyr Grafana data source plugin allows you to create and visualize graphs
and dashboards in Grafana using data in Scalyr. You may want to use this plugin
to allow you to visualize Scalyr data next to other data sources, for instance
when you want to monitor many feeds on a single dashboard.

With the Scalyr plugin, you will be able to create and visualize your log-based
metrics along side all of your other data sources. It's a great way to have a
single pane of glass for today's complex systems. You can leverage Grafana alerts
based on Scalyr data to notify you when there are possible issues. More
importantly, you'll soon be able to jump to Scalyr's fast, easy and intuitive
platform to quickly identify the underlying causes of issues that may arise.

## Prerequisites

* **An installed Grafana server instance with write access**: This document
assumes that an existing instance of Grafana already exists. If you need help
bringing up a Grafana instance, please refer to the [documentation provided by
Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/installation/).
* **A Scalyr read log API Key**: A Scalyr API key is required for Grafana to pull
data from Scalyr. You can obtain one by going to your account in the Scalyr
product and selecting the “API Keys” from the menu in the top right corner. You
can find documentation on API Keys [here](https://www.scalyr.com/help/api#scalyr-api-keys).

## Getting started

1. If you want a stable version of plugin, download the desired version from
[github releases](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-grafana-datasource-plugin/releases).
If you want the `development` version of the plugin,
clone the [plugin repository](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-grafana-datasource)
from GitHub.

    ```bash
    git  clone https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-grafana-datasource-plugin.git
    ```

2. Grafana plugins exist in the directory: `/var/lib/grafana/plugins/`. Create a folder for the scalyr plugin:

    ```bash
    mkdir /var/lib/grafana/plugins/scalyr
    ```

3. Copy the contents of the Scalyr plugin into grafana:

    Stable version:

    ```bash
    tar -xvf scalyr_grafana_plugin_3cb3128.tar.gz
    cp -rf dist/ /var/lib/grafana/plugins/scalyr/
    ```

    Development version:

    ```bash
    cp -r scalyr-grafana-datasource/dist/ /var/lib/grafana/plugins/scalyr/
    ```

4. Adding plugins requires a restart of your grafana server.

    For init.d based services you can use the command:

    ```bash
    sudo service grafana-server restart
    ```

    For systemd based services you can use the following:

    ```bash
    systemctl restart grafana-server
    ```

### Verify the Plugin was Installed

1. In order to verify proper installation you must log in to your grafana instance
   and navigate to **Configuration Settings -> Data Sources**.

    ![FirstImage](images/ConfigDataSource.png)

2. This will take you into the configuration page. If you already have other data
   sources installed, you will see them show up here. Click on the **Add data source** button:

    ![SecondImage](images/DataSoureConfig.png)

3. If you scroll down on the resulting page you should see “Scalyr Grafana
   Datasource” show up in the “Others” section.

    ![otherPlugin](images/OthersPlugin.png)

4. Click on ***“Select”***. This will take you to a configuration page where you
   insert your API key mentioned in the prerequisite section.

    ![PluginConfig](images/PluginConfig.png)

5. Enter these settings:

    |Field Name | Value|
    | --- | --- |
    |Scalyr API Key | Your Scalyr Read Logs API Key|
    |Scalyr URL | `https://www.scalyr.com` or `https://eu.scalyr.com` for EU users.|

6. Click ***Save & Test*** to verify these settings are correct.

## Using the Scalyr Datasource

Now that you’ve completed installing and configuring the Scalyr data source plugin,
lets go through an example of how you can start using it to create a dashboard
using Scalyr data.

1. Create a new dashboard by click Create > dashboard

    ![CreateDashboard](images/CreateDashboard.png)

2. In the **“New Panel”** box, select the **“Add Query”** icon

    ![AddQuery](images/AddQuery.png)

3. From the Query dropdown, select **"Scalyr Grafana Datasource"**.

    ![ScalyrPlugin](images/ScalyrPlugin.png)

4. A query datasource consist of 4 parts:
    * **Function**: You are given a list of the function that can be applied to
    the Facet values.
    Scalyr [graphFunctions documentation](https://www.scalyr.com/help/dashboards#graphFunctions)
    is a good resource to see the list of supported functions.
    * **Facet**: The name of the event field to be graphed.
    * **Conversion Factor**: (Optional) Value to multiply the values of the graph, useful for converting units.
    * **Label**: (Optional) Label for the query. This is displayed as the series title in the graph legend. Same value
    as the `Query` field by default.
    * **Query**: Query filter to be used. This field supports [Scalyr query syntax](https://www.scalyr.com/help/query-language).
    * **DataLink URL**: A read-only generated field, this link can be copied to a new DataLink (at the end of the Visualization
    section). This DataLink will go to the logs in the Scalyr used to create this graph.

5. Fill out all the fields and click the save button. In the image below, we’ve
   added a query to graph CPU Utilization. In general, if you have used graphs and
   dashboards within Scalyr, you should be able to port those over to grafana
   using the same Scalyr query syntax.

    ![CPUQuery](images/CPUQuery.png)

You’ve successfully installed, configured and created a graph in Grafana using Scalyr data!

Note: you can add multiple queries to a visualization to plot multiple series on the same graph.

## Variables

Queries support all Grafana variable substitution syntaxes, for example:

```bash
$varname
[[varname]]
${varname:option}
```

For multi-value variables there is a custom default substitution method, the values will be quoted and seperated with
commas, for example:

```bash
"value1","value2","value3"
```

The expected use of multi-value variables is for `in` queries, for example:

```bash
$serverHost=($host)
```

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. Breakdown graphs are currently not supported. These may be supported in the
   future.

2. Power Queries is an experimental feature and requires the user to change the
   visualization to a ***“table”*** inside Grafana. You can also attempt to graph
   your results with a ***“graph”*** visualization, by setting the x-axis mode
   to ***“series”***.

3. Complex queries with multiple functions are currently not supported. These may
   be supported in the future
   
4. Generated DataLinks only support variables in their default format (With no
   option passed in) due to limitations in format during variable substitution
   in DataLinks.
